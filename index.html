          Hi, I'm Marena, a Pittsburgh-transplant belly-flopping into the tech world. My professional background is varied but I've spent the greater portion of the last 8 years making feature films and television. I'm an assiduous reader with a penchant for language, so when I began researching my career-pivot a year ago web development emerged as a natural fit for my skillset. 
          I was accepted to Penn's LPS Coding Bootcamp in December 2019 and am presently laying the groundwork for a career as a full-stack coder. I come to the coding world with a desire to work and connect with other learners, doers, and helpers. My aim is to carve a space for myself in this vast landscape by creating work that is thoughtfully designed, functional, and engaging. 
          
          I value life-long learning, curiosity, openness, and hand knits. 
          
          Give me the opportunity to share what I could bring to your company, smash that "contact" button.
          In the supremely canny and cogent wisdom of The Judds: Why NOT me?
